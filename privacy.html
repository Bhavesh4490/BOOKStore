      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead">Last updated: <strong>04 November 2025</strong></p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>BOOKStore</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect and process the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, email address(if you sign in with Google), and any information you provide when you create an account.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> pages visited, features used, timestamps, and analytics data that help us understand how our site is used.</li>
         </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain our services, including account management and customer support.</li>
        <li>To process sign-ins and authentication (e.g., Google Sign-In).</li>
        <li>To improve and personalize your experience, develop new features, and analyze usage for product improvements.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect our rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to remember your preferences, enable certain features, analyze site usage, and support advertising where applicable. You can manage cookie settings in your browser. Note that disabling cookies may affect site functionality.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may use third-party services to provide certain features (for example, Google Sign-In, analytics providers, hosting services such as Vercel, and Firebase for authentication). These third parties may collect or process data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their policies separately.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics).</li>
        <li>Law enforcement or government agencies when required by law or to protect our legal rights.</li>
        <li>Third parties in connection with a merger, sale, or business transfer — with notice to users when reasonably possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data using encryption, secure servers, and best practices. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure. Please keep your account credentials safe and notify us of any unauthorized access.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide services to you, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights such as accessing, correcting, or deleting your personal data, or restricting its processing.</p>

      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>BOOKStore is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will post the updated policy here with a new effective date. Continued use of our site after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
